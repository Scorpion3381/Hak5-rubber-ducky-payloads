# Hak5-rubber-ducky-payloads
A harmless prank that turns off the victom pc within a minute.
First it opens the windows start menu, then types "cmd" for command prompt.
it then opens command prompt and types in "turnoff/s"
then it preses ENTER and exicuts the shutdown!

note: It can take up to one minut to turn off the pc and will give a notofication saying so. 
If you see any errors in this code, please let me know at: JonathanHNeelsFM@yahoo.com and I will try to fix them!
